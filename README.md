# ATIP-OCR
It is perennial problem in Canada that municipal, provincial, and federal government agencies disclose records by default in a non-machine readable (image) format. Excel files, for instance, are often printed and scanned by access coordinators before they are released to the requester. In some cases, coordinators may be willing to release the data in a "raw" format, however, this is not always the case. Fortunately, there is a free and open-source solution to this problem using the Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine.
