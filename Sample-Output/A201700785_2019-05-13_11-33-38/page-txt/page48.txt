Assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of tools to address
‘corporate: ‘wrongdoing |

° Behaviours-linked to corporate wrongdoing undermine fair competition, threaten the
_integrity of markets, constitute barriers to economic growth, increase cost and risk of
doing business, and undermine public and investor confidence.

+ Canada has a strong set of measures to address corporate wrongdoing, including
amending or updating legislation (i.e., Corruption.of Foreign Public Officials Act,
Competition Act, etc.) and implementing non-legislative initiatives (i.e., Codes of Conduct,
Integrity Regime, Federal Contracting. Fraud Tip Line, etc. )

° itis important to continually assess whether the right tools are in place.

~ * Time is right to now seek feedback on two elements that relate to Canada’s efforts to
address corporate wrongdoing: enhancements to the Integrity Regime and the possible
adoption of Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs) in Canada.
