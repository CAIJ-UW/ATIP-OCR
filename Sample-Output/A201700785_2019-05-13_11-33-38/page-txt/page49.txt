Consulting on enhancements to the Integrity Regime and the possible
introduction of DPAs

Consulting on the Integrity Regime i is an opportunity to assess whether it is achieving its
objectives in an efficient manner, ensure that it addresses new trends and risks ina

constantly changing marketplace, and reflects the Government’s highest ethical standards

~— Under the Regime, if a supplier is convicted of one of the listed offences in Canada or
a similar offence abroad within the last 3 years, the supplier will be ineligible to be
awarded a contract or real property transaction for a period of 10 years.

— - Regime is policy-based debarment scheme — similar in structure to others used by
PTs and other jurisdictions internationally.

Introduction of a DPA regime could also be considered as an additional tool to ensure

corporate criminality is subject to effective, proportionate.and dissuasive penalties, while
strengthening detection, compliance and corporate culture.

— Under a DPA, criminal prosecution is suspended on the accused agreeing to fulfil
certain requirements including admitting to facts that would support a conviction,

paying a significant financial penalty and cooperating with authorities, on completion
of which, charges will be withdrawn.

Introduction of a DPA in Canada would require legislation; models are.in place i in US,

UK, and a proposal is under development in Australia. 3
