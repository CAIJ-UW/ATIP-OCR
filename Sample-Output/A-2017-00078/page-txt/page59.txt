UPCOMING ACTIVITES OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS

ICSR’s Syria team is currently working on three upcoming reports.

1. An exploration of the convergence of online and offline communities in facilitating a
foreign fighter’s journey to Syria and their subsequent group affiliation.

2. Aprofile of foreign fighters from North America - who they are and how they go. We
also explore what differences and similarities exist between those who go from
Europe and North America.

3. We will expose the route and networks that practically allow someone to get from
Europe - and Britain in particular - into Syria.

Upcoming public events include: -

1. Presentation of our findings at the IDC Herzliya conference in Israel.
2. Presentation of our findings to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry at the
prestigious annual Henriette van Lynden lecture series.
3. Presentation of findings at Singapore Centre of Excellence for National Security.
4. Further meetings lined up for briefings with HMG departments including the Home
, Office, Ministry of Defence, and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.
