3- Either way, we need to update the deliverables table in your original contribution agreement (attached for
easy reference above, and I’ve also attached the previous amendment to your project budget). Our finance folks
will not allow us to release payment if a deliverable has not been completed before the end date listed in Annex
A, in the project work plan. I’ve copied and pasted the table below, if you could propose any necessary changes
in wording and completion dates, that would be great. Please feel free to do this as a reply to this email, and
highlight any changes in a different font color © Brett will get back to us on the restricted briefing papér issues
as soon as possible. :
