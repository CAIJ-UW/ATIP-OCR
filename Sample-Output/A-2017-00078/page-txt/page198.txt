Hello Jean-Philippe,
Unfortunately Palantir is not an approved software at Public Safety and cannot be used.

Good morning,
Please advise as soon as possible as the reporter’s deadline was yesterday.
The confirmation of receipt email doesn’t help me in this case. Please provide a contact ASAP.

Thanks,

JP Levert
