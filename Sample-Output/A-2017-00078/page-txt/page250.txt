Many thanks for looking into this for me. I do have a follow-up I'm hoping you can look into for me.

There are at least two Public Safety employees who appear to list using Palantir software as part of their work.

1, https://www.linkedin.com/in/

 

2. https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-sharpe-b2658363/

Can you provide any clarity here? It seems to suggest that Palantir software is, in fact, used — but I want to be
sure.

Apologies for not sending this along with my initial request. I only came across it yesterday.

Thanks again,

The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We do not have at this
time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.
