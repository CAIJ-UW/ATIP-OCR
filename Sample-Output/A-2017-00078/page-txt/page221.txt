Subject: Re: CBC News / Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

Is it possible that Public Safety employees were entering data into Palantir software that was
purchased/operated/approved for use by another government department? I'm not trying to be difficult here, but
I really can't square why multiple people from the same government department would claim to have used this
software as part of their Public Safety duties.

Hi again,

As previously mentioned, Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We
do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.
