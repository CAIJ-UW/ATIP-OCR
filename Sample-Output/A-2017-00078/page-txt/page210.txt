Also, can you please provide a list of all communities in each
of the two zones: floodway and flood fringe.

* If it help[s, the Flood Risk Maps could be limited to the
Ottawa-Gatineau area.

Otherwise, if you can provide the full list of communities in
the floodway and flood fringe, as well as the exemptions in
Quebec that would be great.

I am seeking an update on the planned Canadian Cannabis
Survey mentioned in the April 2017 backgrounder on the
legalization of marijuana.

(*) When will the first survey take place?

(*) Who will administer it? e.g. Statistics Canada, another
agency?

(*) Do you have any details on how it will work?

Preparation regarding expected increase in natural disasters

In 2008, and updated in 2014, NRCAN did a report Canada
in a Changing Climate.

I’m wondering what kind of follow up has been done since
2014 in terms of preparing for the expected increase in
floods and forest fires and droughts etc.

McKenna and Goodale both talked yesterday about the fact

because of climate change but what is the government doing
to prepare for such scenarios?

The Government is working with provinces and territories,
Indigenous Peoples, municipalities, private sector partners
and non-government organizations to develop a
comprehensive strategy to help Canada better
prevent/mitigate, predict, prepare for, respond to, and
recover from weather-related emergencies and natural
disasters. The current flooding situation will certainly be top
of mind as we come together to advance our common goal
of reducing the impact of disasters on Canadians from coast
to coast to coast. Strengthening the resilience of
communities to disasters continues to be a priority for
