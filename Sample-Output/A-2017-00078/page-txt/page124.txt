No problem!

My notes basically reiterate what is in the first email above, and I’ve also included your reply to Shiraz re: restricted
briefing paper:

“One thing to keep in mind, with this kind of change, is not to double-count work for the online/offline paper with that
for the restricted briefing paper".

In the first email you'll see what they committed to completing in the “extension document” word document.

Thanks! Do you have notes from our Feb. 23 call with Shiraz on this stuff, or an email where one of us confirmed the
Status of the restricted briefing paper? My notes are that I'd review their Ottawa paper and get back to them to
determine if it met the commitment, and (’m pretty sure | said it was too limited to be considered equivalent to a 5000
word paper. I’m trying to track that down, but if you have it handy, please let me know. .
