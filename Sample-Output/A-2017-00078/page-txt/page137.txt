HiJP

| don’t believe we have the same operational concerns as RCMP/CSE/CSIS. If IT confirms that we don’t have a contract
with this company, we should share that with the reporter.

Thanks

Hi Andrew,
Agencies are now responding directly to this call. (RCMP, CSIS and CSEC)

| now have confirmation that CCIRC doesn’t have contracts with them and has not purchased licenses for their software.
| have sent an email to IT asking them to advise for the department.

At this point, should we follow the agency trend and provide the proposed response below? We could run it by legal?
(Do we have a specific contact for Legal?)

Please advise.

Thanks,

JP Levert

PROPOSED RESPONSE:

Public Safety Canada is not able to discuss details concerning which companies we do or do not have a business
relationship with. As a result, we are unable to confirm whether we use Palantir products.
