Flood Risk Maps

The reporter originally contacted Environment Canada.

I'm hoping you can provide copies of Flood Risk Maps for
each province participating in the Flood Damage Reduction
Program.

The specific maps I’m looking for are the following:
Flood Risk Maps

1. Large scale engineering maps usually at a scale of
1:2000 or 1:5000 are used to accurately delineate
the flood risk area. They are available for perusal or
purchase from local offices or provincial agencies.

2. Public information maps, with scales ranging from
1:5000 to 1:25000, are used to show the
approximate location of the flood risk area and
provide the public with information on the Program.
They are available to the public.
