Understood. But why then would people who say they worked at Public Safety list Palantir software under a
description of their job duties?

As mentioned in our previous response, Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved
software list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.

_ Hi Jean-Philippe—

Many thanks for looking into this for me. I do have a follow-up I'm hoping you can look into for me.

‘ There are at least two Public Safety employees who appear to list using Palantir software as part of their work.
