Hello JP,

I cannot speak for PS writ large but CCIRC does not use Palantir products.

Good afternoon Ken,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your
consideration.

DEADLINE: 5 pm today

 

JOURNALIST: |

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Can you please advise if PSC has contracts with them or has purchased licenses from their software. If you don’t know,
could you please advise who might?

Thanks,
Jean-Philippe Levert
