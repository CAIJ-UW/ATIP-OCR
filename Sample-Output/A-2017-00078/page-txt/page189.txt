Good afternoon Andrew,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis anda proposed
response for your approval.

DEADLINE: 5 pm yesterday. Reporter has followed-up today.

 

JOURNALIST:

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

PROPOSED REPSONSE: The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software
list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir

Alex Martel (For GOC)
