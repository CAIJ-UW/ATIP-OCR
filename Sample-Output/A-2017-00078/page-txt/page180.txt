2017) that shows the total number of people to be 8,960? In that case,
you only have 395 people who've crossed at the Emerson border so far
this year, correct? Have Ontario and Quebec always been the most
crossed provinces? If so, why the international attention on Emerson?

Second Follow-up: May 9 at 3:50 pm:

Thank you again for your help in finding answers to my questions. Just
to reiterate: I’m looking to confirm which set of numbers I should use,
as referenced in my original message. I'd also be curious if you’re
planning on updating those numbers soon to include the month of May.
Beyond that, would the government have any statistics on the ethnic
breakdown of those refugees crossing the border? I’m also interested in
whether there's any information about the criminal rates among them
AND the number of people crossing who are actually children (any kind
of age breakdown available?).

Finally, I understood from my interviews it typically takes refugees
anywhere from two to four months before they find out whether they’ve
received refugee status in Canada. Do you happen to know the
percentage of people who currently qualify for that status?

I know I’m asking a lot of specifics here. Please let me know if I also
need to contact another department.

Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir
Technologies. Do you know if Public Safety has any contracts with them,
or has purchased licenses for their software?

The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our
approved software list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously
had, a contract with Palantir.
