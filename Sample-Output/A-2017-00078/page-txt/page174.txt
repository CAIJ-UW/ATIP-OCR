Subject Canadians having traveled to Kurdistan to fight ISIS

Questions My name is = |) 2 2 and I'ma freelancer for CBC Radio.

 

I'm doing a radio documentary on Canadians who have traveled to
Kurdistan in Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS, with an emphasis on Syria.

Proof: http://www.cbe.ca/radio/docproject/meet-our-new-mentees-
1.3987975

I was just wondering if Public Safety Canada had any estimates on how
many Canadians are currently in Kurdistan as part of the war against
ISIS. Even better would be if you know the divide between Syria and
Iraq.

I spoke to a graduate student at Laval University who is studying this
issue, and he estimates that there are about 40 Canadians (that's for
both Syria and Iraq). I was just wondering if I could get the
government's estimate of the number. I spoke to Global Affairs and they
directed me to you.

I'm not working on a tight deadline, but if I could get an estimate before
the end of the week that would be great.
