1911 Document Released Under the Access to
Ss. ( ) Information Act / Document divulgué en vertu
de la Loi sur l'aceés 4 l'information

Hi there—

I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to
me by EOD on this.

Thanks,
