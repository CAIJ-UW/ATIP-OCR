Subject: CBC News / Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

Hi there—
I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public

Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to
me by EOD on this.
