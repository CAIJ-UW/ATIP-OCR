Subject: Media request for PCO awareness: CBC News / Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

Good afternoon Christine, Lynn,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis and our response
for your awareness.

DEADLINE: 5 pm yesterday. Reporter has followed-up today.

JOURNALIST:|. — CBC

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

REPSONSE: The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We do not
have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert

Hi there—
I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to me
