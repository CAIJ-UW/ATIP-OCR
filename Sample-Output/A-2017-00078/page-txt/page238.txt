Hi Christianne, Comms mistakenly directly sent this Media Request to us regarding use of Palantir Software. Guylaine
has resolved the matter such that we will no longer get directly tasked, but has asked we provide a response. !f you
approve the response, it will be sent on to Caroline.

RESPONSE:

The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a parto of our approved software list. We do not have at this
time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.”

Response was confirmed with Procurement.

Thank you,
