Hi

 

As mentioned in our previous response, Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved
software list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.

Regards,

JP Levert

Hi Jean-Philippe—
Many thanks for looking into this for me. I do have a follow-up I'm hoping you can look into for me.
There are at least two Public Safety employees who appear to list using Palantir software as part of their work.
