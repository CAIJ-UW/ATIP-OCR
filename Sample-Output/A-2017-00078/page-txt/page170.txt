Good morning NCSB team,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your
consideration.

DEADLINE: 5 pm today

 

JOURNALIST: =

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Paiantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately. ,

Please advise who in NS might be able to advise if PSC has contracts with them or has purchased licenses from their
software.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert

Hi there—
