Subject: Media request: CBC News / Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

Good afternoon colleagues,
Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your input.

Please advise if advise if the RCMP, CBSA, CSIS and/or CSEC have contracts with them or have purchased licenses from
their software.

DEADLINE: 3:30 pm today

 

JOURNALIST:

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert

Hi there—
I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to me

by EOD on this.
