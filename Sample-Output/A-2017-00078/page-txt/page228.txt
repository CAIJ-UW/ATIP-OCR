Can you provide any clarity here? It seems to suggest that Palantir software is, in fact, used — but I want to be
sure.

Apologies for not sending this along with my initial request. I only came across it yesterday.

. Thanks again,

The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We do not have at this
time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.
