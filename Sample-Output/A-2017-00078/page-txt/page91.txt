Dear Brett,
I hope this message finds you well.

I realise this has been about a week overdue, but Paris - once again - made life very hectic over here.

_ Attached is a first draft of our online report. It's way longer than expected and still requires some editing and

addition of Appendices, but it should give you a good sense that the product is in hand. It goes against much of
the coriventional wisdom about online radicalisation, and should create a fair amount of healthy debate. We
anticipate publication in January.

Our online portal on foreign fighters has now been launched. There are currently about 500 items that can be
looked at and searched, with 500 more to follow. The link is here:

I hope this provides you with the content needed to get the final sign off for the rest of our grant. If there's any
problem, please just let me know.

Once again, many thanks for all your support over. the years. I hope we can remain involved, as we are certain
to continue working on this.

Best wishes,
Peter
