Subject: SecDev: Palantir and US Government Fraud Oversight Program

On Friday, June 18th 2010 US Vice President Joe Biden and Office of Management and Budget Director Peter

Orszag held a press conference at the White House announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus by

the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB). Vice President Biden credited the success to the

software being deployed by the Federal Government. He also announced that the capability will be deployed at
- other US government agencies with significant budgets, starting with Medicare and Medicaid.

Palantir is the software platform used to help the government fight fraud and root out shady contractors.

An excerpt from USA Today:

to-bar-shady-contractors

"New software, widely in use in the private sector but just now being deployed by the federal government, will
enable Uncle Sam to end ... [fraud], Vice President Biden and White House Budget Director Peter Orszag said
today. It allows the government to cross-check multiple databases [i.e. data integration] for background

on prospective contractors. Orszag showed one example where five "companies" were traced to the same
address: a house with a swimming pool and a boat dock.

The software already is in use to monitor contracts issued under the $787 billion economic stimulus act; now it
will be deployed to other big-spending government agencies, starting with Medicare and Medicaid.

Biden predicted this will result in significant savings of taxpayer dollars. "We have weapons we didn't have or
didn't use before," he said."

OMB Director Peter Orszag adds from his blog:

"I am a huge fan of data and am really impressed by this tool. It gathers enormous quantities of information — in
real time — and then analyzes the data and helps connect the dots to identify indicators of possible fraud or
error.” ,
