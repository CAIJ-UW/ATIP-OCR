Introduction

The impact of online communication on processes of radicalisation has been vigorously debated
for years. Extremist groups were among the first and most enthusiastic adopters of the internet —
a medium which they believed was free of government control and censorship, allowing for their

there is practically no extremist group that doesn’t have an online presence — though th their
activities vary in degree and sophistication.

Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in 2011, jihadist groups are widely thought to have
broken new ground. Their use of social media is believed to be massive and sophisticated. For
‘Islamic State’, it has come to be seen as a central and distinctive feature of its modus operandi,

potential supporters.’ It is the latter — the role of online communications in radicalization and
recruitment - that is the subject of this report. What impact does social media have on wannabe
foreign fighters from Western countries? How do they use the internet, and — most importantly —
