Good afternoon,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your input.
Please advise if this should be sent to another email address for IT.

DEADLINE: 5 pm today

JOURNALIST:

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? ,

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Please advise who might be able to advise if PSC has contracts with them or has purchased licenses from their software.
This might be for the agencies.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert
