Subject: Media request for DG Tomlinson's immediate approval: CBC News / Does Public Safety

use Palantir software?

Good afternoon Jamie,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis and a proposed
response for your approval.

DEADLINE: 5 pm yesterday. Reporter has followed-up today.

JOURNALIST:,

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

PROPOSED REPSONSE: The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software
list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir

APPROVED BY:

Alex Martel (For GOC)

Adam Hatfield (For CCIRC)
Guylaine Tremblay

CMB ADM (For rest of department}
Andrew

Ashleigh

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert ,
