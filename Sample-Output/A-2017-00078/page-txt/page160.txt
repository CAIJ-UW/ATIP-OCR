Good afternoon colleagues,

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your input.

Please advise if advise if the RCMP, CBSA, CSIS and/or CSEC have contracts with them or have purchased licenses from
their software.

DEADLINE: 3:30 pm today

JOURNALIST:

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there
_ seems to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,
Jean-Philippe Levert
