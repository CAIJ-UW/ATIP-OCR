Good afternoon colleagues, :

Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data anatysis-for your input.

Please advise if advise if the RCMP, CBSA, CSIS and/or CSEC have contracts with them or have purchased licenses from
their software.

DEADLINE: 3:30 pm today

 

JOURNALIST:

 

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there
seems to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,
Jean-Philippe Levert
