As mentioned in our previous response, Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved
software list. We do not have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.

Hi Jean-Philippe—
Many thanks for looking into this for me. I do have a follow-up I'm hoping you can look into for me.

There are at least two Public Safety employees who appear to list using Palantir software as part of their work.

Can you provide any clarity here? It seems to suggest that Palantir software is, in fact, used — but I want to be
sure.

_ Apologies for not sending this along with my initial request. I only came across it yesterday.
