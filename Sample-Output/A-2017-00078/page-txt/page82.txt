Subject: FW: Kanishka Evaluation - Request for. documents

Brett,

Here’s the key highlights doc. It responds to the bulk of the items requested by Audit. There are two elements in it that
highlighted in yellow; | believe them to be accurate, but I’d appreciate if you could confirm them. The rest I’ve been able
" to either confirm independently or by consulting Cassandra. :

I could really use your help/insight for Items | and J. | assume that the [CSR study that is mentioned (The Syria Conflict:
the Evolution of al Qaeda and other Militant Movements after the Arab Spring) should bé ready soon; would that be the
research that is alluded to in your recent exchanges with King’s College?

More importantly, you probably would be much better placed than | am to know about any reports that may not have
been released publicly, and about any decision/advisory documents that I’m not yet familiar with. ‘

For the AG/WG/SC, I’ve inserted the meetings+RoDs that I’ve found on RDIMS, but I’ve got the feeling that there’s a bit
that | haven’t found re: the Advisory Group. The info that’s there comes from my chat with Cassandra, and I’m not able
ta corroborate or confirm the info for that one. Yasmeen.and Connie helped me out, and we've found evidence of a
total of three meetings. Would there be others you'd be aware of? Would we have had RoDs for these?

 

 

 

 

 

 

Working Group Frequency of meeting | # of times has met over | Are there records of
the past five years decisions (can we have
access to these, if
required)
Steering Committee Once per round of 5 Yes (access could be
. funding arranged)
Working Group Once per round of 5 meetings+1 telcon Yes (access could be
funding arranged)
Advisory Group Ad hoc 3 No

 

 

 

 

(We could optionally offer to share ToRs of these groups with Audit.)

Here are the dates of the meetings I’m aware of:

Steering Committee: 7 Feb 2012, 5 June 2012, 21 January 2013, 23 May 2013, January 2014.
Working Group: February 2012, 31 May 2012, 6 May 2013, 10 January 2013, December 2013.
Advisory Group: 9 Jan 2014, 24 Jan 2014 (Telcon), 5 Nov 2014.
