Hi Brett - document attached.

If you read the ‘update’ document first, then you'll see why I've attached the ‘foreign fighter’ document.
Please let me know if this is suitable otherwise I can rework it as need be.

Best,
Shiraz.

Hello again Shiraz,

Sorry to nudge but big boss’ office here is looking to set up a briefing, so just wanted to check when you might
be able to send that wee update, so I can get back to them on timing...

Will you be able to hit send soon? Thanks in advance!
Best,

Brett.
