Hi Christianne, Comms mistakenly directly sent this Media Request to us regarding use of Palantir Software. Guylaine
has resolved the matter such that we will no longer get directly tasked, but has asked we provide a response. If you
approve the response, it will be sent on to Caroline.

RESPONSE:
The Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We do not have at this
time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.”

Response was confirmed with Procurement.
Thank you,

Shawn Smith-Chao

Good morning,
Please advise as soon as possible as the reporter’s deadline was yesterday.

The confirmation of receipt email doesn’t help me in this case. Please provide a contact ASAP.
