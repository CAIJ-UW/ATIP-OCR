Given that CSE and CSIS are both ready to go with a response, you can get back to RCMP and ask them to respond
directly as well.

Thanks

| think I’d rather just answer for us. Trying to coordinate all of the various contracting units of all the portfolios will be a

Thanks

No confirmation on the lead at this point, but | assume that PS would take the lead if the response implicates PS-
Portfolio agencies.

‘Vil keep you posted.
