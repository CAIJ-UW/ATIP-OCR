" Telegram can be scraped for valuable content which can be used to guide counter messaging
" Such scraping can be applied ta a much larger data set and across languages, given the
appropriate expertise for both.
= Forward looking studies, such as this one, can be done not only on Telegram but many other
' platforms to which IS and other groups are active on/will migrate to.

Recommendations Going Forward:
- Facilitate effective inter-government, multilateral, and private-public partnerships in the facilitation, creation,
dissemination and tracking of online counter-messaging campaigns.
o This includes defining the role(s) of government and the elements of such effective partnerships.
© Increase the agility of these relationships and the production and dissemination of counter messaging
products. -
- Incorporate tracking measurements and initiatives to highlight the reach and resonance of counter-messaging
campaigns, creating a feedback loop for product improvement and the establishment of best practices.
‘ - Engage with target communities, both to understand the reach and resonance of counter-messaging and to
inform future initiatives, and to suggest core elements/facets of counter-messaging campaigns.:
- Incorporate forward thinking analysis in an attempt to predict and adapt counter messaging to the rapidly
changing environment (inclusive of a shift to new platforms, new messaging techniques and new message
content/narratives).

Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of this in person, might be able to come up with some additiona! points during a
