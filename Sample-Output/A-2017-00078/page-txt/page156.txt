Given that CSE and CSIS are both ready to go with a response, you can get back to RCMP and ask them to respond
directly as well.

Thanks

I think I’d rather just answer for us. Trying to coordinate all of the various contracting units of all the portfolios will be a
pain. Let’s see what our own people come up with and then see who would respond.

Thanks

No confirmation on the lead at this point, but | assume that PS would take the lead if the response implicates PS-
Portfolio agencies.

I'll keep you posted.

Allo jean-Philippe,

We have received the same request from Mr. ..We are looking into it at this time... Are you taking the lead for all

the portfolio agencies?

 

Thanks
