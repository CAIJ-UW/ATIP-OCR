Hi Jean-Philippe,
GOC does NOT have any contracts with Palantir, and has not purchased any licenses for their software.

Alex.

Good afternoon,
Please see below, a media request we received regarding Palantir Technologies and big data analysis for your input.

Please advise if the GOC has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? CCIRC has confirmed
it doesn’t and IT is presently preparing their input.

DEADLINE: 5 pm yesterday — Please advise as soon as possible
JOURNALIST: : a — CBC

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert
