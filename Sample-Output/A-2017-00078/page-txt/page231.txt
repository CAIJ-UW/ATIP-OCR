Subject: For Jamie's Approval: CBC News / Does Public Safety use Palantir software?

Hi Jamie

Please see below an exchange between our team and the CBC on a call you had approved yesterday. The CBC journalist
has come across Linkedin profiles that seem to suggest that our information is incorrect. We confirmed twice with CMB
that we do not have a contract with this company and reiterated our same response to the journalist. He is now asking
for comment on the accounts. Our suggested response is below.

DEADLINE: 4:45 PM
JOURNALIST: |
QUESTIONS: !'m writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Why then would people who say they
worked at Public Safety list Palantir software under a description of their job duties?

RESPONSE: Public Safety Canada does not comment or speculate on the content or accuracy of private social media
accounts. Again, Palantir software is not used at Public Safety, nor is it a part of our approved software list. We do not
have at this time, nor have previously had, a contract with Palantir.

 

| can provide additional context should you have any questions.

Thanks
-Andrew

Understood. But why then would people who say they worked at Public Safety list Palantir software under a
description of their job duties?
