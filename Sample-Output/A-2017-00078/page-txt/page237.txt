FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: There are at least two Public Safety employees who appear to list using Palantir software as
part of their work.

1. https://www.linkedin.com/inf
2. httos://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-sharpe-b2658363/

Can you provide any clarity here? It seems to suggest that Palantir software is, in fact, used — but | want to be sure.

 

 

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Thanks,
