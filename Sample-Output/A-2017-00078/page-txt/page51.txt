ICSR uppaTe, MaRcH 2015

This has been one of the busiest times for ICSR since its inception in 2008, particularly
due to events stemming from the Syria/Iraq conflict impacting heavily on our research
into the Islamic State and the. accompanying foreign fighter trend. In particular, the
declaration of ‘the new caliphate’ by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the violent progression of
Islamic State’s presence into Iraq, the execution of journalists at the hands of a British
foreign fighters and recent terrorist attacks in Ottawa, Sydney and Paris have all directly
related to ICSR’s workload.
