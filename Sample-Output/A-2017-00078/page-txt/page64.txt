Overview of Norwegian Police

As of 2016-01-01, Norway will go from 27 to 12 police districts. Though the move was met with
resistance from local politicians, the consolidation was widely supported by the national:
government and police alike. This move was one of the key recammendations that came out of
the 7/22 Report (the independent report following the 2011 terror attacks). By decreasing the
number of police districts, the police plans to significantly increase the tactical capability of each
district.

Although the 7/22 report was very critical of the police, it also revealed that there is virtually no
corruption in Norwegian police, the public has very high trust in the police and that the corps

_ has high academic standards. Every Norwegian police officer must have a three year degree

from the Police University College, which is very competitive. Every year some 5000 students
apply for 700 spots; 20% of all applicants already hald a bachelor degrée from another
institution. For six years running, police prosecutor has been the most popular career choice for

Norwegian law graduates.
