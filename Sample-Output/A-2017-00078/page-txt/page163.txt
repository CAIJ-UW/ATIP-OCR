Document Released Under the Access to
s.1 9(1 ) Information Act / Document divulgué en vertu
de la Loi sur l'accés a l'information

I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know-if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to
me by EOD on this.

Thanks
