JOURNALIST:

QUESTION: I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software?

NOTES: Palantir Tehcnologies’ datan mining software has been used by several Us intelligence agencies and there seems
to be some problems emerging between Palantir and the US intelligence agencies lately.

Please advise who might be able to advise if PSC has contracts with them or has purchased licenses from their software.
This might be for the agencies.

Thanks,

Jean-Philippe Levert

Hi there—

I'm writing a story about a big data analytics company called Palantir Technologies. Do you know if Public
Safety has any contracts with them, or has purchased licenses for their software? Hoping you can get back to me
by EOD on this.
